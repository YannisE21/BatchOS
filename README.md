## Overview

BatchOS is a unique project that demonstrates the capabilities of batch scripting by implementing an entire operating system. Though it may not be practical for daily use, it showcases creative problem-solving and programming skills.

## Usage

BatchOS was created primarily for fun and as a proof of concept. While it lacks the functionality and polish of mainstream operating systems, it serves as an interesting exploration of batch scripting.
