## Overview

BatchOS is a unique project that demonstrates the capabilities of batch scripting by implementing an entire operating system. Though it may not be practical for daily use, it showcases creative problem-solving and programming skills.

## Usage

BatchOS was created primarily for fun and as a proof of concept. While it lacks the functionality and polish of mainstream operating systems, it serves as an interesting exploration of batch scripting. 

## License

BatchOS is distributed under the MIT License, allowing for wide usage and modification. For more detailed information, please refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/YannisE21/BatchOS/blob/main/LICENSE.md) file in the repository.
